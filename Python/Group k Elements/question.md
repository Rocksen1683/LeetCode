# Group k Elements
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in **any order**.

## Constraints:

```1 <= nums.length <= 105```
```-104 <= nums[i] <= 104```
k is in the range [1, the number of unique elements in the array].
It is guaranteed that the answer is **unique**.
