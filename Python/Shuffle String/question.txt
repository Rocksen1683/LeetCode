You are given a string s and an integer array indices of the same length. The string s will be shuffled such that the character at the ith position moves to indices[i] in the shuffled string.

Return the shuffled string.

Constraints:

s.length == indices.length == n
1 <= n <= 100
s consists of only lowercase English letters.
0 <= indices[i] < n
All values of indices are unique.
